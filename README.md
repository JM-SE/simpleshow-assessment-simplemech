# Simpleshow Developer Assesment - SIMPLEMECH X

#### Overview:

The purpose of this assessment is to test potential candidates on their ability to build a standard interaction employed by simpleshow. In this case, the candidate will be
examined in building a Drag & Drop feature using simpleshow assets. Illustration will provide the vectorized assets (SVGs) needed to send the potential candidate for use in
building this interactive. The theme is playful: a mech suit build in the vein of Japanese mecha comics/cartoons, “Pacific Rim,” and “Iron Man.”

#### Interaction:

To succeed, the potential developer needs to use the assets provided to program the (literal) build. The interaction is to have the user Drag & Drop each individual part of the mech suit until the full robot is complete. The parts include: the head, 2 arms, 2 legs, and the simpleshow hand emblem for its chest. (These parts can be placed in random order.) These parts are dropped onto the mech suit’s body/frame.

#### Technologies used:

-   HTML, CSS, Javascript (All Vanilla).
-   [PlainDraggable](https://anseki.github.io/plain-draggable/) Drag & Drop Library.
